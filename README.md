# Nobody wants your newsletters!
Seriously, bloggers. Nobody wants your newsletters. 

I plan on being very aggressive on this. 

This means attempting to counteract psuedo-random naming of elements. As I'm futzing with the regular expressions, things may break.

My goal is to make this as future-proof as possible so that we're not adding entries for every new blog that pops up.

PRs to the community filters list are welcome, but anything dedicated to a specific site will be rejected. 

Add "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koepnick/nobody_wants_your_newsletter/main/ublock_filters.txt" to your filters list
