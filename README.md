# Nobody wants your newsletters!
Seriously, bloggers. Nobody wants your newsletters. 

I plan on being very aggressive on this. 

This means attempting to counteract psuedo-random naming of elements. As I'm futzing with the regular expressions, things may break.

My goal is to make this as future-proof as possible so that we're not adding entries for every new blog that pops up.

PRs to the community filters list are welcome, but anything dedicated to a specific site will be rejected. 

This is something that I'll be updating as my righteous indignation increases. Basically I'll be adding features as I get annoyed by the browsing experience. 

Though not *technically* a newsletter popup, I despise the recent login nags from Google. The nags which, in order to disable, requires you to be **logged in**! So I'm nuking that as well.
